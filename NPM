✅ What Is npm?
npm stands for Node Package Manager.

It is:

A tool that helps you install, manage, and share packages (libraries or modules) for JavaScript projects.

The default package manager for Node.js.

If you're building a Node.js backend or React frontend, you’re already using npm.

✅ What Does npm Do?
Installs Packages/Libraries:

Example:

npm install express
npm install react
Manages Dependencies:

All installed packages and their versions get recorded in a file called package.json.

You don’t have to manually track everything.

Runs Project Scripts:

Defined in package.json.

Example:

npm start
npm run build
Shares Your Project:

You can publish your own npm packages.

✅ Files Involved:
package.json:
Stores project name, version, dependencies, and scripts.

package-lock.json:
Ensures that the exact version of every installed package is recorded and used.

node_modules/:
Directory where npm installs all your packages locally.

✅ Common npm Commands
Command	Purpose
npm install	Install all dependencies listed in package.json
npm install <package>	Install a specific package
npm start	Run the start script defined in package.json
npm run <script>	Run any custom script defined in package.json
npm uninstall <package>	Remove a package
npm update	Update all installed packages

✅ Why npm Matters for You
Since you're building projects like Local Store App with:

Frontend: React

Backend: Node.js + Express

npm helps you manage all required packages without manually downloading and linking files.
